Biogas Storage Model of UC Davis' Renewable Energy Anaerobic Digester (READ)

This model is a base which assumes a certain feed rate, biogas yield, year of operation (with its own price curves), and yearly expenses. To interpret the results of this model, all of the technical assumptions should be altered or confirmed to make sure the output is realistic for the facility which you are trying to model.
